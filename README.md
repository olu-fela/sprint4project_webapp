# sprint4project_webapp - Random Event Simulator

## Project Description

The Random Event Simulator is a versatile tool designed to simulate random events based on predefined probabilities or completely stochastic processes. 
It allows users to model and analyze various scenarios where randomness plays a key role, such as decision-making processes, statistical experiments, or even gaming outcomes. This project is built to be simple, modular, and extensible for a variety of use cases.

## Features
- Simulate random events using customizable configurations.
- Generate reports or visualizations of outcomes.
- Modular design for easy extension and integration.


## Technologies and Packages Used
This project leverages Python for its implementation and uses several libraries to streamline its functionality:
- Python: The core language used to implement the project.
- Pandas: For organizing and analyzing simulation data.
- Streamlit: For building and sharing interactive web apps.
- Altair: For creating interactive declarative visualizations.
- Plotly Express: For quick and easy creation of interactive plots and charts.
- NumPy: For random number generation and mathematical computations.
- Matplotlib: To visualize simulation results (e.g., histograms, probability distributions).


## Installation and Setup
To run the Random Event Simulator on your local machine, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:
- python --version

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository from GitHub or download the source code.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
git clone https://github.com/olu-fela/random-event-simulator.git
cd random-event-simulator
</div>

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

### On macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

### On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 4: Run the Application
Run the main script to start the simulation.

python main.py

## Usage
- Define your random events and their probabilities in the configuration file (e.g., config.json).
- Execute the simulation to generate random outcomes.
- View results in the console or as visualizations in generated files.

## Example Configuration
Below is an example of a configuration for a simple coin toss simulation:

{
  "events": {
    "Heads": 0.5,
    "Tails": 0.5
  },
  "iterations": 1000
}
